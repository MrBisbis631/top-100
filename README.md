# Top 100

**Top 100** is a program designed for graduated Computer Science students to prepare you for the job market. The goal of this project is to help you improve your problem-solving skills by providing solutions to the top 100 most commonly asked coding problems in technical interviews. You'll find solutions in **C++**, **Python**, and more technologies to help you excel in your job search.

## Features

- **100 LeetCode Problems**: Curated list of the most frequently asked coding problems in technical interviews.
- **Multiple Languages**: Solutions provided in C++ and Python for each problem.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Each problem includes a detailed explanation of the solution approach.
- **Technology Stack**: Introduces you to other technologies, concepts, and best practices to prepare for real-world development.

## File structure

The project is organized into directories by lecture numbers. Each lecture directory contains subdirectories for specific LeetCode problems and standalone exercise files. The general structure is as follows:

```
<lecture_number>/ <problem_number>-<problem_name>/ Solution.cpp
# or 
<lecture_number>/ <exercise_name>.cpp
```

- **Lecture Directories**: Each lecture is represented by a numbered directory.
- **Problem Subdirectories**: Each problem within a lecture has its own subdirectory named `{problem_number}-{problem_name}` containing a `Solution.cpp` file.
- **Exercise Files**: Standalone exercise files are named descriptively and placed directly within the lecture directories.
